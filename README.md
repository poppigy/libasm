<h2 style="color: #5e9ca0;">libasm project at 21 School (Moscow)</h2>

<p style="color: #af00a0;"><span style="color: #339966;">The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language</span></p>
<ul>
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming
language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong
(but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architectureâ€™s
machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer
architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable
across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language
may also be called symbolic machine code.</li>

<p>In order to run this project om MacOS you need to have NASM installed.</p>
To compile the project use Makefile
